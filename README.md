# Linear Regression with Keras

This repository contains an example of linear regression implemented using Keras and TensorFlow. The code is based on examples originally developed by Adrian Bevan, and subsequently adapted by Abbey Waldron and Alexander Booth from Queen Mary University of London for educational purposes.

## Overview

This example demonstrates a linear regression problem using the model:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

The Adam optimizer is employed to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. The implementation includes:
- Data generation with noise.
- Model definition and training using Keras.
- Visualization of the loss function evolution.
- Comparison
